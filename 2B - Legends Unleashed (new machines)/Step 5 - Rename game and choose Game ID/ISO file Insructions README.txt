I recommending replacing the ISO.hdr file with ONE of the files in this folder. The file you select must go into 'root\&&systemdata'

The files with "NA" in the file name are for the NA version of the game. JP for the Japanese version. EU for the PAL version

If you desire a separate save from from your base GX save file, copy over the file whose game ID (eg UFZE01) starts with a U. Otherwise select the one whose game ID starts with a G.

European version: Replace with ISO_EU_UFZP01 or ISO_EU_UFZP01
Japanese version: Replace with ISO_JP_UFZJ01 or ISO_JP_UFZJ01
North American version: Replace with ISO_NA_UFZE01 or ISO_NA_UFZE01

Once you paste the file to the %%systemdata folder, remove the original ISO.hdr file, and rename the file you copied over to ISO.hdr.

If you do change the game ID, then make sure you configure the files associated with cheat codes appropriately if you plan on using them.
If you want to use cheat codes on Nintendont with the any of the game IDs that start with "U", you must make an adjustment to your Nintendont for it to work. See the test file in the Cheat Codes folder to get instructions on how to do that.

If using Dolphin, make sure to right-click on the game -> Properties -> then check 'Enable FPRF' & 'Synchronize GPU Thread'.
This will fix the broken menu / camera issues.
