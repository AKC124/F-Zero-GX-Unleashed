- Dolphin
Use Dolphin's Memcard Manager (under tools) to import the .gci file into one of your memory cards.

- Nintendont
Copy the GFZE.raw or UFZE.raw file into the "saves" folder in your USB storage or SD card.

If you replace the ISO.hdr with the one that I provide, you must use the save file with "UFZE" in the filename.
Otherwise use the save file with "GFZE" in the file name

Renaming Game Name
You can hex edit the GCI save file to edit the game name. I have already re-named it to F-Zero GX Unleashed v5.0
